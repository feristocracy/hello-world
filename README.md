# hello-world
This is my first repository! I'm unstoppable
My name's Fer and I'm a junior developer so far, I'm 35 and I love everything about technology, gadgets, videogames and everything a geek would like.
I'm a backend developer and I'm looking forward to working in very important companies around the world!
See you soon...
